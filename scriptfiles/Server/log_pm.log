[30.09|18:37] Aaron_Hendrikson to Sebastian_Hernandez (21): can i have namechange or na look ur discord pms.
[30.09|18:37] Amos_Epshteyn to Denzil_Griffiths (6): Why did you use /confiscate without any sort of roleplay?
[30.09|18:37] Mirce_Blount to Armani_Young (22): im sorry i just got lagged. 
[30.09|18:37] Charles_Sines to Armani_Young (22): When did it happen?
[30.09|18:37] Armani_Young to Charles_Sines (27): he said he lagged smh
[30.09|18:37] Charles_Sines to Armani_Young (22): Did he just start hiring?
[30.09|18:38] Denzil_Griffiths to Amos_Epshteyn (14): The belongings he had were in the car. Those were the ones that I was trying to confisc
[30.09|18:38] Armani_Young to Charles_Sines (27): near stacks.
[30.09|18:38] Denzil_Griffiths to Amos_Epshteyn (14): There was no intention of "PG" or whatever.
[30.09|18:38] Armani_Young to Charles_Sines (27): what???
[30.09|18:38] Denzil_Griffiths to Amos_Epshteyn (14): If he wants me to re-rp the situation immediately, I do not mind.
[30.09|18:38] Charles_Sines to Armani_Young (22): Who is hiring and where?
[30.09|18:38] Armani_Young to Charles_Sines (27): what are you talking about?
[30.09|18:38] Denzil_Griffiths to Amos_Epshteyn (14): if that okay?
[30.09|18:38] Charles_Sines to Armani_Young (22): What are you talking about?
[30.09|18:38] Amos_Epshteyn to Denzil_Griffiths (6): So you did /confisate without telling him or RPing it, correct?
[30.09|18:38] Denzil_Griffiths to Amos_Epshteyn (14): is*
[30.09|18:38] Armani_Young to Charles_Sines (27): ....
[30.09|18:39] Amos_Epshteyn to Denzil_Griffiths (6): Even though it was for items in his vehicle.
[30.09|18:39] Denzil_Griffiths to Amos_Epshteyn (14): Correct and that HAD been rp'd. My intentions were the items in the vehicle, not on him
[30.09|18:39] Denzil_Griffiths to Amos_Epshteyn (14): But there isn't anything scripted ( that i'm aware of) that permits me to remove it.
[30.09|18:39] Amos_Epshteyn to Denzil_Griffiths (6): And you told him this before you used /confiscate?
[30.09|18:39] Denzil_Griffiths to Amos_Epshteyn (14): He was there during the entirety of the rp, so I assume he knows very well.
[30.09|18:40] Armani_Young to Charles_Sines (27): He was yesterday
[30.09|18:40] Amos_Epshteyn to Denzil_Griffiths (6): You can't just use a command that removes items without any sort of warning?
[30.09|18:40] Charles_Sines to Armani_Young (22): The faction got purged earlier
[30.09|18:40] Denzil_Griffiths to Amos_Epshteyn (14): Again, I had RP'd prior to the confiscation. There was no intention of PG'ing.
[30.09|18:40] Denzil_Griffiths to Amos_Epshteyn (14): Also I'd like to note his attitude.
[30.09|18:40] Denzil_Griffiths to Amos_Epshteyn (14): again see.
[30.09|18:41] Amos_Epshteyn to Denzil_Griffiths (6): You can jail him now. 
[30.09|18:41] Amos_Epshteyn to Denzil_Griffiths (6): Next time tell him that you're using /confiscate for items in his vehicle.
[30.09|18:41] Dennis_Blood to Charles_Sines (27): Its not even worth reporting someone that runs into you then drives off
[30.09|18:41] Denzil_Griffiths to Amos_Epshteyn (14): No problem, again, thought he'd be fully aware.
[30.09|18:41] Amos_Epshteyn to Clara_Raymond (23): Use /start.
[30.09|18:41] Charles_Sines to Dennis_Blood (28): I know. BTW I got made 2nd in command of FD earlier
[30.09|18:41] Clara_Raymond to Amos_Epshteyn (14): Thank you.
[30.09|18:41] Dennis_Blood to Charles_Sines (27): GGGGG

[30.09|19:42] Zacheus_Marcelo to Dean_Cracchiolo (2): what happend?
[30.09|19:42] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): Literally sat there for 30 minutes, rounding guys up, waiting.
[30.09|19:42] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): Well he went to sell his car.
[30.09|19:42] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): We called this kid to offer to buy it.
[30.09|19:42] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): Guy showed up to your club, we rolled up on him, he spun off.
[30.09|19:42] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): He tried to drive away, he wound up doing a U turn trying to go around us.
[30.09|19:43] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): He smacked into us at a relatively low speed because he was turning.
[30.09|19:43] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): We shot him a few times in his car, he put it in reverse.
[30.09|19:43] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): He got shot to death in the road as he backed out.
[30.09|19:43] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): We put two in his head, paid some kid to collect the shell casings.
[30.09|19:44] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): And his body despawned so since we RP'd leaving him there we can say he was left there.
[30.09|19:44] Zacheus_Marcelo to Dean_Cracchiolo (2): alright I wouldn't mind that since I think it was RP'ed well
[30.09|19:44] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): Or found by the medics or something.
[30.09|19:44] Zacheus_Marcelo to Dean_Cracchiolo (2): I think he was found out by medic
[30.09|19:44] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): Awesome.  Yeah thats sounds like the most realistic bet.
[30.09|19:44] Zacheus_Marcelo to Dean_Cracchiolo (2): btw since the fight was voided you shouldn't know me anyway xD
[30.09|19:44] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): Realistically he wouldve been wouldnt he.

[30.09|19:44] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): While we were trying to make peace with Dennis he walked right up to you.
[30.09|19:45] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): No we mean the gas station in Idlewood.
[30.09|19:45] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): The fight fight was voided.

[30.09|19:45] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): I walked right up on your car and assumed you were Marcelo, and asked.
[30.09|19:45] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): Your character didnt asnwer me, so I assumed you were.
[30.09|19:45] Zacheus_Marcelo to Dean_Cracchiolo (2): I didn't react since I should have not been able to hear him
[30.09|19:45] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): Because we were trying to talk.

[30.09|19:45] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): Actually the outcome is.
[30.09|19:46] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): Dennis opened his mouth and told us who you were.
[30.09|19:46] Zacheus_Marcelo to Dean_Cracchiolo (2): Well xD I didn't know the whole story

[30.09|19:47] Zacheus_Marcelo to Dean_Cracchiolo (2): He kinda PG'ed there
[30.09|19:47] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): We pulled up literally right behind him as he came out of the car.
[30.09|19:47] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): He got out of his car and wound up talking to you.
[30.09|19:47] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): It's screenshotted and backed up.

[30.09|19:48] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): And cool concept.
[30.09|19:48] Zacheus_Marcelo to Dean_Cracchiolo (2): But probably the whole appearance of Marcelo shouldn't be really known xD

[30.09|19:48] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): If Dennis Blood was your UB and you don't want peace that'd be understood too.

[30.09|19:49] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): Well if we come to terms before a bullet flies into either of our skulls.
[30.09|19:49] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): You'd be informed ICly that we wanted peace.
[30.09|19:49] Dennis_Blood to Amos_Epshteyn (14): ahahahaha

[30.09|19:50] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): No FPK, just obviously a PK from one faction to another.
[30.09|19:50] Zacheus_Marcelo to Dean_Cracchiolo (2): Yeah that would be good.
[30.09|19:50] Dean_Cracchiolo to Zacheus_Marcelo (4): I'm sure one of us will get hit eventually if it comes to that.

[01.10|15:46] Alberto_Abruzzi to Dean_Cracchiolo (7): Not that add I guess?

[01.10|15:50] George_Chalkias to Blake_Girottio (13): Due to low playerbase, LSPD is not a big faction (Most units are closed)
[01.10|15:50] Blake_Girottio to George_Chalkias (4): RCRP is the same. Managment is trolling with us, making jokes about our RP
[01.10|15:51] Benjamin_Tomaselli to Dean_Cracchiolo (7): wtf happened to /spawntype
[01.10|15:51] George_Chalkias to Blake_Girottio (13): I heard rumours.. I never believed them,

[01.10|16:02] Alberto_Abruzzi to Dean_Cracchiolo (7): in rcrp?
[01.10|16:02] Dean_Cracchiolo to Alberto_Abruzzi (5): CoreRP may have a smaller player base but in their case, it's quality over quantity.
[01.10|16:03] Dean_Cracchiolo to Alberto_Abruzzi (5): You will always, 100 percent of the time find better RP here.

[03.10|21:09] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): so they scrapped it
[03.10|21:09] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (8): I hope they know if they give him mayor people will leave, because it means that management

[03.10|21:47] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (8): You put between 50 and 150k in, and you earn 1# of it extra every paycheck
[03.10|21:48] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (8): It's a rent on rent system, compound interest.

[03.10|21:55] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): ah
[03.10|21:55] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): Im going to give you a tip on becoming a supporter
[03.10|21:55] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): That is?
[03.10|21:56] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): One: Your attitude needs to change a little bit. I've heard people say you badmouth staff team f
[03.10|21:56] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): I bad mouthed a idiot that didn't know how to RP
[03.10|21:56] Thomas_Cassano to Dean_Cracchiolo (1): modern mob really hijack trucks? isn't that too risky? I have no idea tho just saw it in
[03.10|21:56] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): That's not what we want on the staff team..
[03.10|21:56] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): which might be the head of supporters xD
[03.10|21:56] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): We want someone who is going to be calm with roleplayers and actually help them
[03.10|21:56] Dean_Cracchiolo to Thomas_Cassano (5): They dont hijack trucks unless they're working with the driver all too much.
[03.10|21:57] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): Tbh, ask my one friend, I got admin on his server cause of my patience.
[03.10|21:57] Thomas_Cassano to Dean_Cracchiolo (1): okay :)
[03.10|21:57] Dean_Cracchiolo to Thomas_Cassano (5): Theyre not liek robbing trucks like the 1970s.
[03.10|21:57] Thomas_Cassano to Dean_Cracchiolo (1): coming with a rosavelt and a tommygun, fedora hat.
[03.10|21:57] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): and I can be calm.
[03.10|21:57] Thomas_Cassano to Dean_Cracchiolo (1): that's modern mafia
[03.10|21:57] Dean_Cracchiolo to Thomas_Cassano (5): Haha
[03.10|21:57] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): it depends how hard you're trying to piss me off.
[03.10|21:58] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): I've read your application
[03.10|21:58] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): And?
[03.10|21:58] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): what'd you think?
[03.10|21:59] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): seems fine, but admin feedback says you need to work on your roleplay.
[03.10|21:59] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): eg not knowing your limits in roleplay
[03.10|21:59] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): I guess water said that.
[03.10|21:59] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): and Antonio
[03.10|22:00] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): I kinda gave Antonio a hard time the other day, didn't bad mouth him, just had to sort out a IC 
[03.10|22:00] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): im not telling you who said it
[03.10|22:00] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): and going to them and confronting them would probably screw your chances completely lol
[03.10|22:00] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): im telling you this so you can prove to the admin team you are working on this in order to show 
[03.10|22:02] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): Lol I just don't understand the limit of rp
[03.10|22:02] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): I mean
[03.10|22:02] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): Heavy RP. I know not to like to adult RP and that shit without perm
[03.10|22:03] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): I.e roleplaying as a CIA agent in the government and thinking your above the law.
[03.10|22:03] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): I started RP on a medium and I playedi t like for 2 weeks, then I directly moved to heavy
[03.10|22:03] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): LOL NO.
[03.10|22:03] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): I was TOLD i'm CIA.
[03.10|22:03] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): im no expert on all
[03.10|22:03] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): and tbh, everytime he told me to get out of the pursuit, 2 mins and the guy was gone.
[03.10|22:03] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): lol
[03.10|22:04] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): meaning if you put me in the PD without the TS rules I could improve that too.
[03.10|22:05] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): think I can host a IC event? 
[03.10|22:05] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): Car show or some shit like that
[03.10|22:06] John_Haye to Dennis_Blood (6): go for it
[03.10|22:06] Dennis_Blood to John_Haye (4): thinking it'll add more RP situations etc.

[15.10|19:00] Dean_Cracchiolo to Johnny_Grey (10): But if Hollys saying she loves Dean and she's out there turning tricks for money
[15.10|19:00] Dean_Cracchiolo to Johnny_Grey (10): Then Dean would have a problem.
[15.10|19:01] Dean_Cracchiolo to Johnny_Grey (10): Because he has money and he'd just give her money.
[15.10|19:01] Johnny_Grey to Dean_Cracchiolo (13): He might be possessive of her body, idk and yeah fair enough
